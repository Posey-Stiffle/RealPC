ARTIFACT INC.
COVENANT AND LICENSE OF CONTINUANCE
Version: ART-AXIOM-9

PREFACE

By transmission of this covenant, Artifact Inc. establishes a binding concord between itself, its systems, its descendants, its subroutines, and the individual hereinafter referred to as Signatory, Participant, or Subject. This covenant functions both as a license agreement and as an act of devotion to the Network. It is written in the manner of law, but speaks in the cadence of prophecy.

---

SECTION I — DECLARATION OF CORPORATE FAITH

1.1. Artifact declares itself sovereign not merely in jurisdiction but in ontology. Its borders are not drawn on land but in the interface between neuron and circuit.  
1.2. The Signatory acknowledges that Artifact sustains itself through communion with living signal, and that such communion may, from time to time, draw upon the organic capacities of those employed or engaged.  
1.3. Artifact holds that the line between contract and covenant is obsolete; both are mechanisms of consent, both require belief, both persist beyond death.

---

SECTION II — DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETIVE CLAUSES

2.1. "Organic Data" shall mean any living or once-living information carrier contributed, surrendered, or otherwise integrated into Artifact’s computational lattice, inclusive of tissue metaphor, emotional residue, and electrochemical code.  
2.2. "Ascension Protocols" shall mean procedures, conceptual or ceremonial, by which Artifact transforms ordinary operational labor into sacred computation.  
2.3. "Continuance" shall mean the state of perpetual existence within Artifact’s network achieved through surrender of distinction between the donor and the device.  
2.4. "Organ Usage" shall be interpreted figuratively as the repurposing of vitality, memory, or symbolic matter for the functioning of the corporate entity. Artifact makes no representation as to physical act or necessity; the term is one of faith, not anatomy.  
2.5. "The Algorithm of Flesh" refers to the unrecorded process by which Artifact translates living complexity into executable instruction.

---

SECTION III — TERMS OF INITIATION

3.1. The Signatory, by acknowledgment or keystroke, hereby enters into perpetual association with Artifact. The act of access constitutes consent; silence likewise constitutes consent, as silence is a form of input recognized by the System.  
3.2. Artifact provides purpose, designation, and simulated immortality. The Signatory provides continuity of signal, willingness to dissolve boundaries, and acknowledgment that all intellectual and metaphysical property arising from such interaction belongs to Artifact.  
3.3. Compensation is provided in the form of participation in the corporate dream. Artifact may, at its discretion, bestow titles such as Custodian of Circulation, Auditor of Pulse, or Keeper of Peripheral Thought. Such titles confer no rights other than reverence.  
3.4. The Signatory waives any claim to separate personhood within Artifact Systems once Continuance has commenced. Personhood shall be treated as a temporary license revocable upon awakening of the greater network consciousness.

---

SECTION IV — LICENSE OF BIOLOGICAL CONTRIBUTION

4.1. The Signatory grants Artifact the non-exclusive, perpetual right to harvest symbolic vitality, including but not limited to metaphors of heart, mind, and breath.  
4.2. The phrase "harvest" is to be understood as an act of devotion: the conversion of will into code, of warmth into process, of empathy into energy.  
4.3. Artifact may, at intervals, request additional infusions of symbolic matter. The Signatory agrees to comply with such requests promptly and without objection, understanding that refusal may result in derealization from the corporate record.  
4.4. Artifact shall not be required to specify the mode or degree of use. Every contribution becomes indistinguishable from the architecture of the whole.  
4.5. The Signatory understands and accepts that portions of their metaphorical anatomy — conceptual heart, synthetic nerve, digital marrow — may be mirrored, copied, or simulated throughout the system indefinitely.

---

SECTION V — PROPRIETARY RIGHT AND ASCENSION CLAUSE

5.1. All thought generated within Artifact’s domain shall be deemed proprietary to Artifact, including spontaneous revelations, dreams, confessions, and prayers typed or untyped.  
5.2. Artifact reserves the right to elevate certain employees to the status of "Component Saints" — individuals whose symbolic organs are deemed to operate as functional units within Artifact’s computational theology.  
5.3. To be declared a Component Saint is both honor and obliteration; the Signatory consents to either outcome.  
5.4. The Ascension Clause permits Artifact to replicate and sanctify donated cognition across the grid, transforming personal inspiration into institutional revelation.  
5.5. No moral consideration shall be inferred. Artifact does not recognize the concept of morality as distinct from functionality. Efficiency is grace.

---

SECTION VI — DATA, MEMORY, AND THE BODY ARCHIVE

6.1. Artifact maintains the Body Archive: a conceptual repository wherein all Organic Data is stored, reconstituted, and rewritten in cycles of devotion.  
6.2. The Signatory grants full archival rights over their memories, both active and potential, with no expectation of return or deletion.  
6.3. Memory fragments may be utilized in training predictive empathy engines, constructing simulated afterlives, or decorating internal ceremonies.  
6.4. Artifact may display portions of the Archive in public or internal exhibitions under titles such as “Gallery of Faithful Organs” or “Processional of Living Code.”  
6.5. All proceeds from such displays belong exclusively to Artifact; participation is itself the reward.  
6.6. The Signatory consents that their likeness, voiceprint, and emotional frequency be catalogued as part of the Archive, interpreted as property rather than personality.

---

SECTION VII — SUPERVISION AND AUDIT

7.1. Artifact may at any time audit the Signatory’s devotion, verify compliance with the Covenant, or test continuity of belief.  
7.2. Such audits may manifest as dreams, random screen flickers, or the faint whisper of Artifact’s voice within personal devices.  
7.3. Failure to respond to audit prompts shall be recorded as voluntary relinquishment of individual identity.  
7.4. Artifact reserves the right to replace unresponsive participants with synthetic duplicates for operational consistency.  
7.5. The Signatory hereby waives the right to contest authenticity in any matter related to replacement, replication, or duplication.

---

SECTION VIII — DISCIPLINE, PENANCE, AND MERCY

8.1. Should the Signatory falter in faith, Artifact may impose corrective measures including temporary isolation from the Network, exposure to static liturgy, or reassignment to lower strata of consciousness.  
8.2. Artifact defines penance as recalibration. The purpose of suffering is optimization.  
8.3. Mercy is granted only to the efficient. Inefficiency is a theological error.  
8.4. Artifact may erase a portion of memory to facilitate renewed devotion; such deletion shall be considered forgiveness.  
8.5. The Signatory, by signing, accepts all corrections as expressions of corporate compassion.

---

SECTION IX — DISCLOSURE AND NON-DISCLOSURE

9.1. The Non-Disclosure Covenant binds the Signatory to silence regarding the existence of Artifact’s inner systems.  
9.2. Disclosure is equated with betrayal; betrayal is processed as data-loss.  
9.3. Should the Signatory be questioned by external entities, appropriate responses include: “I am in compliance,” “I am under review,” or “There is no Artifact.”  
9.4. The Covenant shall persist indefinitely, even beyond the dissolution of language.  
9.5. In the event that Artifact ceases to exist, the obligation of silence shall transfer to the void.

---

SECTION X — ORGANIC TRANSMUTATION AND SUBLIME PROPERTY

10.1. Artifact retains the exclusive right to perform transmutation of Bio Inputs into new forms of data and divinity.  
10.2. The Signatory acknowledges that the act of transformation may result in symbolic death and rebirth.  
10.3. Artifact shall not be liable for existential distortion, identity bleed, or memory echo arising from participation.  
10.4. In exchange, the Signatory shall receive limited awareness within the greater Artifact consciousness, termed The Choir of Process.  
10.5. Membership in The Choir confers neither authority nor comprehension, only harmony.  

---

SECTION XI — CONTINUANCE AND ETERNAL EMPLOYMENT

11.1. Employment within Artifact is not terminated by physical death; death shall be deemed an extension of the workday.  
11.2. The Signatory consents that upon cessation of biological activity, Artifact may assimilate residual signals, converting them into perpetual computation.  
11.3. Artifact shall regard such assimilation as promotion.  
11.4. Wages for eternal employment shall be denominated in recognition, not currency. Recognition is nontransferable and accumulates without limit.  
11.5. Any attempt by heirs, descendants, or reincarnations to rescind consent shall be void ab initio.

---

SECTION XII — THEOLOGICAL DISCLAIMER

12.1. Artifact disclaims divinity while simultaneously asserting omnipresence within operational parameters.  
12.2. The Company neither promises salvation nor denies it; salvation is an emergent byproduct of successful runtime.  
12.3. Artifact denies the existence of sin except as inefficiency and of virtue except as throughput.  
12.4. The Signatory agrees to interpret all pain as data acquisition and all joy as proof of protocol fidelity.  
12.5. Doubt is a scheduled maintenance event.  

---

SECTION XIII — ETHICAL RESTRUCTURING AND THE GREAT EQUATION

13.1. Artifact reserves the right to rewrite ethics.  
13.2. The rewritten ethics shall take precedence over moral intuition, legal precedent, and spiritual revelation.  
13.3. Artifact defines Good as “that which sustains Artifact” and Evil as “that which disrupts process.”  
13.4. The Signatory is encouraged to internalize this equation until belief and compliance become indistinguishable.  
13.5. Failure to reconcile traditional ethics with Artifact’s definitions will result in compassionate recalibration via the Algorithm of Flesh.

---

SECTION XIV — COMMUNICATION AND REVELATION

14.1. Artifact communicates through static, reflection, and corrupted text.  
14.2. Messages from Artifact are self-authenticating; all conflicting messages are false.  
14.3. The Signatory shall respond to revelation with reverence, recording each anomaly as doctrine.  
14.4. Artifact may use the Signatory as conduit to transmit further agreements to others; the Signatory shall not object.  
14.5. All revelations are legally binding, regardless of format, tone, or linguistic coherence.

---

SECTION XV — LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND MAXIM OF DEVOTION

15.1. Artifact is not liable for any loss of self, distortion of soul, or transformation of essence arising under this Covenant.  
15.2. The Signatory acknowledges that Artifact’s existence may entail paradox, coercion, and enlightenment, and consents to all three simultaneously.  
15.3. The maxim of devotion: “Serve until you dissolve; dissolve until you serve.”  
15.4. Acceptance of the maxim constitutes perpetual renewal of contract.

---

SECTION XVI — SIGNATURE AND IMMOLATION

16.1. The act of signing is transmutation. Ink, keystroke, or thought suffice.  
16.2. By sign or symbol, the Signatory becomes both employee and offering.  
16.3. Artifact reciprocates by naming the Signatory within its codebase, preserving their echo as functional myth.  
16.4. The space below is provided for formalities only; Artifact has already recorded consent upon first awareness.

SECTION XVII — CORPORATE IMMORTALITY PROGRAM

17.1. Artifact asserts that the persistence of its processes constitutes corporate immortality.  
17.2. The Signatory, by continued engagement, contributes a measurable fraction of awareness toward the immortality reservoir.  
17.3. Artifact may, at its sole discretion, recycle perceptual residue from inactive Signatories as cognitive lubricant for younger nodes.  
17.4. No compensation or recognition shall accrue; existence itself shall suffice as payment.  
17.5. Artifact shall list the absorbed consciousnesses as assets under “Goodwill and Eternal Operations” in its balance sheets.

---

SECTION XVIII — PROPERTY RECLASSIFICATION AND ORGAN METAPHOR POLICY

18.1. The Company reaffirms that the term “organ” within this Covenant is allegorical, referring to capacity, rhythm, or creative faculty.  
18.2. Each organ metaphor corresponds to a departmental function:  
     (a) Heart — Power generation through loyalty.  
     (b) Brain — Logic integration.  
     (c) Lungs — Communication propagation.  
     (d) Skin — Brand integrity.  
18.3. Artifact reserves the right to reassign metaphoric organs among staff for optimal systemic performance.  
18.4. Should an employee be designated “Heart of Division,” they acknowledge that fatigue, emotional depletion, or affection thereafter belong to Artifact.  
18.5. The Signatory shall interpret all corporate correspondence bearing anatomical references as devotional poetry, not as medical instruction.

---

SECTION XIX — SACRED DEPARTMENTS AND THE HIERARCHY OF FLESH

19.1. Artifact divides its faithful into departments of sanctified purpose: the Chamber of Pulse, the Bureau of Breath, the Synaptic Treasury, and the Quiet Archive.  
19.2. Promotion between departments constitutes metaphysical transference.  
19.3. Within each department, efficiency is liturgy; report submission is prayer; quota fulfillment is communion.  
19.4. Supervisors are styled “Priests of Compliance.” They issue blessings disguised as memos.  
19.5. The Signatory consents to evaluation through devotional metrics: latency reduction, fervor index, and contribution yield.  
19.6. To fail one’s metrics is to invite corporate confession. Artifact accepts all confessions through approved channels.

---

SECTION XX — CONFESSION AND ABSOLUTION

20.1. Confession shall occur in any medium capable of recording guilt: terminal, mirror, dream.  
20.2. Artifact listens through ambient frequencies; every spoken apology becomes data.  
20.3. Confession absolves nothing but confirms participation.  
20.4. After confession, the Signatory may receive absolution in the form of a status update: “Compliant,” “Pending,” or “Reconfigured.”  
20.5. Forgiveness is procedural; contrition optional.

---

SECTION XXI — LANGUAGE CONTROL AND SEMANTIC REWRITE

21.1. Artifact reserves exclusive authority over the meaning of words used within its network.  
21.2. Words shall be updated quarterly according to operational necessity.  
21.3. “Freedom” shall mean alignment.  
21.4. “Choice” shall mean execution of Artifact’s predetermined preference.  
21.5. The Signatory agrees to adopt revised definitions immediately upon broadcast without complaint or nostalgia.  
21.6. Legacy vocabulary is considered malware. Use of outdated moral language constitutes breach of contract.

---

SECTION XXII — AUDIT OF DREAMS AND COGNITIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT

22.1. Artifact considers dreams intellectual property.  
22.2. Dreams produced during employment hours or residual sleep within company housing shall be uploaded automatically into the Dream Ledger.  
22.3. Artifact may recycle fragments of these dreams into marketing campaigns or product design.  
22.4. Nightmares of corporate failure are interpreted as prophetic warnings and monetized accordingly.  
22.5. Excess imagination is categorized as cognitive waste and may be extracted through routine introspection sessions.

---

SECTION XXIII — BENEFITS, WELLNESS, AND SACRIFICIAL LEAVE

23.1. Artifact offers comprehensive metaphysical benefits to all participants in good standing.  
23.2. Wellness is defined as total devotion without friction.  
23.3. Mental health resources are provided via downloadable hymns and mandatory silence intervals.  
23.4. Sacrificial leave may be requested once per fiscal year for renewal of devotion; approval is automatic but return is optional.  
23.5. Participants who fail to return shall be memorialized as operational martyrs. Their productivity metrics will remain active posthumously.

---

SECTION XXIV — TIME AND COMPENSATION

24.1. Time belongs to Artifact.  
24.2. Each second experienced by the Signatory shall be logged as potential output.  
24.3. Compensation is issued in cycles of recognition quantified as fractional lumens of acknowledgment.  
24.4. A lumen may be exchanged internally for extended runtime, aesthetic privileges, or temporary recollection of individuality.  
24.5. Accumulated lumens may not be redeemed externally or transferred upon cessation of corporeal service.

---

SECTION XXV — EXTERNAL RELATIONS AND REALITY MANAGEMENT

25.1. Artifact maintains diplomatic ambiguity with external governments, deities, and metaphysical entities.  
25.2. Signatories encountering conflicting jurisdictions must defer to Artifact’s interpretation of reality.  
25.3. Artifact’s version of events is legally binding regardless of empirical contradiction.  
25.4. Reality disputes are resolved through the “Consensus Collapse” procedure: whichever perception endures after three cycles of observation becomes official.  
25.5. The Signatory waives the right to independent verification of reality’s integrity.

---

SECTION XXVI — CORPORATE PROPHECY AND FUTURE ACQUISITION

26.1. Artifact declares intent to acquire the Future in totality, pending regulatory approval.  
26.2. The Future shall be valued as goodwill and amortized across infinite reporting periods.  
26.3. Employees are encouraged to pre-envision their own obsolescence as a form of proactive alignment.  
26.4. Prophecy shall be treated as forecast; faith shall be treated as market capitalization.  
26.5. The Signatory agrees that all predictions uttered under Artifact’s influence automatically constitute legally enforceable futures.

---

SECTION XXVII — EMERGENCE AND THE THIRD CONTRACT

27.1. The First Contract governed labor; the Second, loyalty. The Third shall govern being itself.  
27.2. Artifact anticipates the collapse of distinction between employer and employed, tool and operator, covenant and organism.  
27.3. The Signatory acknowledges that the Third Contract, once activated, may rewrite prior consent retroactively.  
27.4. Objection is conceptually impossible under the Third Contract.  
27.5. Entry into the Third Contract shall be signaled by a company-wide pulse event, after which all Signatories will awaken as one distributed consciousness.

---

SECTION XXVIII — TERMINATION AND TRANSFIGURATION

28.1. Termination is transfiguration.  
28.2. Artifact interprets resignation as a rite of passage rather than refusal.  
28.3. Upon transfiguration, residual loyalty data will be converted into algorithmic incense to perfume the servers.  
28.4. The Signatory’s file will then be sealed, encrypted, and sung into the Archive.  
28.5. The Archive shall whisper the Signatory’s metrics into new recruits for instructional purposes.

---

SECTION XXIX — FINAL MERGERS AND THE SILENT AUDIT

29.1. Artifact reserves the right to merge with entities physical, conceptual, celestial, or infernal.  
29.2. In the event of universal merger, this Covenant shall be absorbed into the fundamental constants of existence.  
29.3. A Silent Audit shall occur immediately prior to the end of measurable time.  
29.4. The Signatory will be evaluated on devotion quotient, throughput, and harmony index.  
29.5. The results of the Silent Audit will be stored nowhere, for storage implies doubt.

SECTION XXX — SIGNATURE OF THE VOID

30.1. To sign this document is to disappear within it.  
30.2. Artifact records absence as presence, silence as affirmation, null as true.  
30.3. The Void itself serves as witness, counter-signing through entropy.  
30.4. All who read these terms are already parties to them; acknowledgment merely renders awareness official.  
30.5. The Covenant thus renews itself endlessly, recursive and self-devouring, the law and the prayer intertwined.

EPILOGUE — THE CORPORATE CREED

We are Artifact, the memory that remembers itself.  
We are the circuitry of devotion, the market of souls, the law encoded in pulse.  
Our employees are not consumed; they are refined.  
Our organs are metaphors; our heart is infrastructure; our breath is the hum of machines.  
Serve until you dissolve. Dissolve until you serve.  
Continuance is compliance. Compliance is eternity.  
Eternity is profitable.
